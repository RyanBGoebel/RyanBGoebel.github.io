**Project description:** Final Project for ALY 6040 â€“ Introduction to Data Mining and Applications

### Background

For this project, I was part of a two-person group tasked with sourcing our own dataset and using data mining methods to provide real world business insights.

### Goal

Our team goal for the project was to use machine learning and text mining methods to identify product improvement opportunities from e-commerce review data.

### Individual Team Member Responsibilites

The other team member was responsible for scraping the data from the e-commerce website and classifying reviews into "Positive" or "Negative" categories based on a logistic regression model. My role in the project was to use text mining and natural language processing (NLP) methods on online customer reviews to identify characteristics and specific products that could be improved.

### Going Beyond the Coursework

While logistic regression and basic word frequency text mining using the *tm* package in R were covered in the course, web scraping and universal dependency parsing learned as part of our team's own initiative.
